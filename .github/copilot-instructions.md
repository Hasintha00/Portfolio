# Portfolio Website - Copilot Instructions

This is a modern portfolio website built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The project includes:

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
- **Icons**: Lucide React for modern, consistent icons
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

## Project Structure
- `/src/components/` - All React components for different sections
- `/src/assets/` - Static assets like images and icons
- Main sections: Header, Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact, Footer

## Design Guidelines
- Use a dark theme with gradient backgrounds (slate-900, purple-900)
- Implement smooth scroll behavior and animations
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Use consistent color palette (blue-500, purple-600, slate colors)
- Follow modern web design principles with clean typography

## Best Practices
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper accessibility features (aria-labels, alt text)
- Follow React best practices (hooks, component composition)
- Use Tailwind classes for styling instead of custom CSS
- Implement smooth animations with Framer Motion

When suggesting code changes or improvements, focus on:
1. Maintaining the existing design system
2. Improving user experience and accessibility
3. Optimizing performance
4. Following React and modern web development best practices
